     - Fill pattern
   
2. Layer Automation
   □ Record:
     - Level changes
     - Effect sends
     - Filter movement
   
3. Performance Recording
   □ Capture:
     - Live variations
     - Control changes
     - Effect tweaks

Success Criteria:
- Solid groove
- Interesting variations
- Musical transitions
```
