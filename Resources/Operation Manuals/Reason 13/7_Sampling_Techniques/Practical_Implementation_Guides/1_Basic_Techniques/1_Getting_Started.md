# Getting Started with Sampling in Reason

## Essential Setup

### 1. Sampling Workspace Setup
```
Required Devices:
- NN-XT Advanced Sampler
- Kong Drum Designer
- RV7000 MkII Reverb
- The Echo
```

### 2. Basic Recording Chain
```
Signal Flow:
1. Audio Interface Input → 
2. Reason Audio Track →
3. Sample Recording Device
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Recording Your First Sample
1. **Setup Recording**
   - Create new Audio Track
   - Set input source
   - Enable monitoring
   - Set appropriate levels

2. **Capture Process**
   ```
   Steps:
   - Press Tab to flip rack
   - Connect inputs properly
   - Set recording level (aim for -12dB peaks)
   - Hit Record + Play
   ```

3. **Sample Editing**
   ```
   Basic Operations:
   - Trim start/end points
   - Normalize if needed
   - Remove DC offset
   - Apply fade in/out
   ```

## Essential Techniques

### 1. Loop Point Setting
```
Perfect Loop Creation:
1. Find zero crossings
2. Match waveform shapes
3. Use crossfade tool
4. Test with different playback speeds
```

### 2. Basic Sample Processing
```
Standard Chain:
1. EQ
   - High-pass below 20Hz
   - Remove problem frequencies
   - Enhance sweet spots

2. Compression
   - Ratio: 2:1 to 4:1
   - Attack: 10-30ms
   - Release: Auto
   - Gain reduction: 3-6dB

3. Basic Effects
   - Light reverb (mix 10-20%)
   - Subtle delay (1/8 or 1/16)
```

## Common Workflows

### 1. Drum Sample Creation
```
Step-by-Step:
1. Record or import sound
2. Edit transient (first 10-20ms)
3. Shape decay tail
4. Process with EQ/Compression
5. Save to Hot Sample List
```

### 2. Melodic Sample Processing
```
Workflow:
1. Identify root note
2. Mark loop points
3. Create velocity layers
4. Set key mapping
5. Add modulation
```

## Tips and Tricks

### 1. Quality Control
```
Checklist:
□ Clean start/end points
□ No unwanted noise
□ Consistent levels
□ Proper loop points
□ Phase coherence
```

### 2. Organization
```
Sample Library Structure:
/Drums
  /Kicks
  /Snares
  /Hats
/Melodic
  /Bass
  /Synths
  /Vocals
/FX
  /Impacts
  /Risers
  /Textures
```

## Next Steps
- Explore advanced sampling techniques
- Learn about layering samples
- Practice sample chopping
- Experiment with time-stretching

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
```
Problem → Solution:
Clicks/Pops → Check zero crossings
Phase issues → Use correlation meter
Timing problems → Quantize or adjust grid
Level inconsistency → Use normalization
