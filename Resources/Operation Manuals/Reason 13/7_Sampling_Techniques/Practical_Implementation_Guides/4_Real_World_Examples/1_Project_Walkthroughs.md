# Real-World Sampling Projects

## Project 1: Modern Drum Kit Design

### Overview
```
Goal: Create a hybrid electronic/acoustic drum kit
Style Reference: Jon Hopkins / Bonobo
Key Elements: Layered kicks, processed breaks, textural elements
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation
```
1. Source Material Selection
   - Acoustic kick drum (close mic)
   - 808 sub kick
   - Vinyl break sample
   - Foley percussion

2. Processing Chain
   Input → Kong → Bus Compressor → Master

   Kong Pad 1 (Kick):
   - Layer 1: Acoustic (high-passed at 100Hz)
   - Layer 2: 808 sub (low-passed at 80Hz)
   - Layer 3: Click attack (band-passed 2-4kHz)

   Effects per layer:
   - Transient shaping
   - EQ matching
   - Phase alignment
```

### Performance Setup
```
Macro Controls:
1. Sub Level (CC#1)
2. Attack Intensity (CC#2)
3. Room Size (CC#3)
4. Filter Cutoff (CC#4)

MIDI Implementation:
- Velocity → Layer balance
- Aftertouch → Filter sweep
- Mod wheel → Effect depth
```

## Project 2: Atmospheric Pad Creation

### Overview
```
Goal: Create evolving atmospheric pad
Style Reference: Tycho / Boards of Canada
Technique: Granular synthesis + convolution
```

### Implementation Process
```
1. Source Recording
   - Record sustained note (strings/synth)
   - Capture room ambience
   - Process through tape

2. Grain Setup
   Settings:
   - Grain size: 80ms
   - Spray: 25%
   - Position LFO: 0.1Hz
   
3. Effect Chain
   Grain → Reverb → Chorus → EQ
   
   Key settings:
   - Reverb decay: 4.8s
   - Chorus rate: 0.3Hz
   - EQ: Gentle high shelf boost
```

## Project 3: Break Processing

### Overview
```
Goal: Transform acoustic break into electronic element
Reference: Amon Tobin / Noisia
Technique: Extreme processing and resampling
```

### Technical Setup
```
1. Initial Processing
   - Clean break recording
   - Beat detection
   - Slice to Rex loops
   
2. Processing Chain
   Input → Kong → The Echo → Pulveriser
   
   Key processing:
   - Heavy compression
   - Filtered delays
   - Distortion coloring
   
3. Resampling Stage
   - Bounce processed loops
   - Re-slice new material
   - Layer with original
```

## Project 4: Vocal Texture Design

### Overview
```
Goal: Create atmospheric vocal textures
Style: Burial / Four Tet
Technique: Time-stretching and granular processing
```

### Implementation
```
1. Source Material
   - Acapella recordings
   - Spoken word samples
   - Ambient vocals
   
2. Processing Methods
   Stage 1 (Time-stretching):
   - Stretch ratio: 400%
   - Formant preservation
   - Grain size variation
   
   Stage 2 (Effects):
   - Reverb wash
   - Delay feedback
   - Filter modulation
```

## Project 5: Bass Design

### Overview
```
Goal: Create dynamic bass instrument
Style: Electronic / Future Garage
Technique: Multi-sampling + synthesis
```

### Technical Implementation
```
1. Sample Recording
   - Electric bass (DI)
   - Synthesizer bass
   - Processed sub
   
2. Processing Chain
   NN-XT → EQ → Compression → Saturation
   
   Layer management:
   - DI bass: 80-400Hz
   - Synth: 40-100Hz
   - Sub: 20-60Hz
   
3. Performance Setup
   - Velocity switching
   - Filter mapping
   - Expression control
```

## Project Tips

### 1. Quality Control
```
Checklist:
□ Phase coherence between layers
□ Consistent output levels
□ CPU efficiency
□ Memory management
□ Backup versions
```

### 2. Performance Optimization
```
Best Practices:
- Bounce CPU-intensive processes
- Use sample rate conversion
- Implement proper gain staging
- Monitor CPU/RAM usage
```

### 3. Creative Variations
```
Experiment with:
- Different source material
- Alternative processing chains
- Unique modulation routings
- Custom macro controls
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
```
Problem → Solution:
1. Phase cancellation
   → Check alignment
   → Use correlation meter
   
2. CPU spikes
   → Freeze tracks
   → Bounce to audio
   
3. Memory issues
   → Sample rate optimization
   → Clear unused samples
