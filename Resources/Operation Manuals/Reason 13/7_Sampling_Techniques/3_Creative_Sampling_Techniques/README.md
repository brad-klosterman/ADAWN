# Creative Sampling Techniques

## Vocal Chop Technique
1. Sample Preparation:
   - Import vocal samples to NN-XT
   - Slice into meaningful segments
   - Create multiple zones
   - Set up key mapping
   - Apply pitch variations

2. Processing Chain:
   ```
   NN-XT > Filter > Pitch Shift > Reverb > Delay
   ```

## Single Note Instrument Creation
1. Setup Process:
   - Import single note sample
   - Map across keyboard
   - Adjust root key
   - Set stretch characteristics
   - Apply envelope shaping

2. Sound Design Chain:
   ```
   NN-XT > EQ > Filter > Character > Space
   ```

## Break Processing
1. Slice Technique:
   - Import break sample
   - Set slice markers
   - Map to keys
   - Apply individual processing
   - Create variations

2. Effect Chain:
   ```
   Kong > RV7000 > Pulveriser > The Echo
   ```

## Creative Layering
1. Multi-Sample Approach:
   - Layer complementary samples
   - Apply different processing per layer
   - Create velocity splits
   - Set up modulation
   - Design crossfades

2. Processing Per Layer:
   ```
   Clean Layer: EQ > Compression > Space
   Character Layer: Distortion > Filter > Delay
   ```

## Advanced Techniques
