   - Set up layers
   - Configure controls
   - Test basic sound

2. Basic Processing:
   - Individual channel processing
   - Bus compression
   - Initial EQ
   - Level balancing

3. Performance Controls:
   - Macro assignments
   - Basic modulation
   - Quick controls
   - Preset saving

### Phase 2: Break Processing
1. Recording Setup:
   - Bus configuration
   - Track routing
   - Loop recording
   - Take management

2. Processing Chain:
   - Kong configuration
   - Effect routing
   - Parallel processing
   - Character design

3. Comp Editing:
   - Take organization
   - Editing workflow
   - Pattern creation
   - Variation design

### Phase 3: Integration
1. CV Routing:
   - Modulation sources
   - Destination setup
   - Matrix patterns
   - Performance controls

2. Frequency Management:
   - EQ coordination
   - Dynamic processing
   - Space design
   - Character balance

3. Performance Setup:
   - Live controls
   - Automation setup

## Creative Applications

### Sound Design Goals
1. Kick Character:
   ```
   Clean sub (Ben BÃ¶hmer)
   + Punchy mids
   + Crisp top end
   = Modern hybrid sound
   ```

2. Break Processing:
   ```
   Vintage character
   + Modern clarity
   + Dynamic processing
   = Chemical Brothers style
   ```

### Integration Goals
1. Frequency Balance:
   ```
   Kick: 40-200Hz focus
   Breaks: 200Hz-8kHz focus
   Shared: Careful transition points
   ```

2. Dynamic Interaction:
   ```
   Kick drives sidechain
   Breaks provide movement
   Combined energy control
   ```
