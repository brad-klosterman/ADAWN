# Break Processing System

## Initial Setup

### Kong Configuration
1. Pad Layout:
   - Pads 1-4: Main Break Slices
   - Pads 5-8: Processed Variations
   - Pads 9-12: Individual Hits
   - Pads 13-16: Effects/Transitions

2. Per Pad Settings:
   ```
   Bus FX: Comp > EQ > Gate
   Hit Type: NN-XT
   Pitch: Adjustable
   Level: -3dB Headroom
   ```

## Processing Chains

### Main Break Chain
```
Kong > Pulveriser (Character) > RV7000 (Room) > The Echo (Space)
```

1. Pulveriser Settings:
   - Squash: 2-3 o'clock (vintage compression)
   - Dirt: 9-10 o'clock (light saturation)
   - Filter: HP at 30Hz
   - Follower: Medium attack

2. RV7000 Settings:
   - Algorithm: Room
   - Size: Medium
   - Decay: 1.2s
   - HF Damp: 3.5kHz
   - Mix: 15-20%

3. The Echo Settings:
   - Delay: 1/16 Triplet
   - Feedback: 35%
   - Filter: On
   - Drive: Light
   - Mix: 25%

### Parallel Processing

1. Clean Chain:
   ```
   Kong > EQ > Comp > Output
   ```
   - EQ: High-pass at 30Hz
   - Comp: 4:1 ratio, medium attack

2. Character Chain:
   ```
   Kong > Scream > Filter > Output
   ```
   - Scream: Tape saturation
   - Filter: Low-pass sweep

## Break Manipulation

### Slice Techniques
1. Main Break:
   - Load into NN-XT
   - Slice at transients
   - Map to Kong pads
   - Apply individual processing

2. Variations:
   - Pitch shifts
   - Time stretching
   - Filter sweeps
   - Reverse sections

### Effect Processing
1. Dynamic Effects:
   - Gating patterns
   - Compression styles
   - Envelope following
   - Transient shaping

2. Character Effects:
   - Tape saturation
   - Bit reduction
   - Sample rate reduction
   - Filter modulation

## Performance Controls

### Macro Setup
1. Filter Controls:
   - Cutoff frequency
   - Resonance amount
   - Envelope amount
   - LFO depth

2. Effect Depths:
   - Distortion amount
   - Delay feedback
   - Reverb size
   - Compression ratio

### Live Techniques
1. Pattern Switching:
   - Break variations
   - Fill triggers
   - Effect snapshots
   - Transition tools

2. Dynamic Control:
   - Volume automation
   - Filter sweeps
   - Effect throws
   - Mute groups

## Integration Methods

### With Modern Drums
1. Layering Technique:
   - Break foundation
   - Modern kick
   - Layered snare
   - Added hi-hats

2. Processing Balance:
   - Frequency splitting
   - Dynamic control
   - Spatial placement
   - Character matching

### Creative Applications

1. Break Transformations:
   - Pitch sequences
   - Rhythmic variations
   - Time stretching
   - Granular effects

2. Performance Tools:
   - Live slicing
   - Effect automation
   - Pattern switching
   - Dynamic control

## Best Practices

### Signal Flow
1. Level Management:
   - Input gain staging
   - Bus processing
   - Parallel balance
   - Output limiting

2. Processing Order:
   - Dynamic control first
   - Character processing
   - Time-based effects
   - Spatial effects

### Creative Tips
1. Break Selection:
   - Clean source material
   - Clear transients
   - Minimal processing
   - Good groove

2. Processing Strategy:
   - Preserve dynamics
   - Enhance character
   - Control frequencies
   - Maintain groove
