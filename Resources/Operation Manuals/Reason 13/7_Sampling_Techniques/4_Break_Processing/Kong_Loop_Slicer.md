# Kong Loop Slicer Setup Guide

## Initial Kong Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. Kong Pad Configuration:
   ```
   Pad 1: Nurse Rex Loop Player
   Assignment: All pads reference Pad 1
   Hit Type: Set all to "Chunk"
   ```

2. Dual Kong Setup:
   - Kong 1: 16 slice version
   - Kong 2: 8 slice version (last 8 pads different)

## Loop Preparation

### Pre-Cut Loops
1. Time Stretching:
   - Hold Option/Alt while dragging
   - Snap to bar lines
   - Match project tempo

2. Rex Conversion:
   - Double-click audio clip
   - Enter Slice Edit mode
   - Right-click > Bounce to Rex Loop
   - Find in Song Samples folder

### Long Audio Files
1. Overview Mode Workflow:
   - Double-click audio clip
   - Enter Overview mode
   - Use R key for Razor tool
   - Cut at transients
   - Delete unwanted sections
   - Time stretch to bars

## Slicing Implementation

### 16-Slice Version
1. Drag Rex Loop to Kong:
   - Automatic 16-part division
   - Equal slice distribution
   - Chromatic key mapping
   - Tempo-synced playback

### 8-Slice Version
1. Alternative Setup:
   - Larger slice sizes
   - Fewer divisions
   - Better for longer phrases
   - Simpler patterns

## Creative Applications

### Pattern Creation
1. MIDI Programming:
   - Draw notes chromatically
   - Quarter note divisions
   - Adjust velocities
   - Create variations

2. Randomization:
   ```
   Right-click > Note Tools > Alter Notes
   Amount: 75% for variation
   ```

### Sound Design
1. Per-Pad Processing:
   - ADSR envelope adjustment
   - Pitch modification
   - Filter settings
   - Level control

2. Effect Processing:
   - Time-based effects
   - Character processing
   - Dynamic control
   - Spatial effects

## Performance Techniques

### Live Control
1. Pattern Switching:
   - Create variations
   - Switch between 8/16 slice modes
   - Real-time parameter control
   - Effect automation

2. Dynamic Control:
   - Velocity modulation
   - Filter sweeps
   - Effect throws
   - Pattern variations

## Integration Methods

### With Modern Elements
1. Layering Strategy:
   - Complement with modern drums
   - Balance frequencies
   - Match dynamics
   - Coordinate patterns

2. Processing Approach:
   - Parallel processing
   - Bus effects
   - Dynamic control
   - Spatial placement

## Best Practices

### Workflow Tips
1. Organization:
   - Label slices
   - Save Kong presets
   - Document settings
   - Maintain templates

2. Creative Process:
   - Start with clean loops
   - Create variations
   - Build complexity
   - Save iterations

### Technical Considerations
1. Audio Quality:
   - Clean source material
   - Proper gain staging
   - Clear transients
   - Tempo matching

2. Performance:
   - CPU management
   - Effect routing
   - Pattern organization
   - Preset management
