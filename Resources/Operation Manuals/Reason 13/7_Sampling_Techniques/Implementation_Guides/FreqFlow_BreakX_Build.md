# FreqFlow_BreakX: Implementation Guide

## Concept Overview

### The Science Behind Break Extraction
```
Key Frequency Bands:
- Kick: 50-100Hz (fundamental energy)
- Snare: 200-500Hz (body), 3-8kHz (snap)
- Hi-hats: 8-16kHz (air and shimmer)
- Room: 300-800Hz (space character)

Why This Works:
- Transient separation preserves groove
- Frequency isolation maintains character
- Room extraction captures vintage vibe
- Phase alignment keeps punch
```

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Create Combinator
```
1. Right-click rack â†’ Create Combinator
2. Name: "FreqFlow_BreakX"
3. Color: Orange (for drum processing)
4. Create Audio Track inside

Purpose:
- Unified processing environment
- Multiple extraction paths
- Parallel processing capability
- Real-time control
```

### Step 2: Device Chain
```
Core Devices (in order):
1. Spider Audio Merger & Splitter
2. MClass Equalizer
3. Pulveriser
4. The Echo
5. Spectrum Analyzer
6. Line Mixer 6:2

Signal Flow Purpose:
- Split for parallel processing
- Independent frequency treatment
- Character enhancement
- Space reconstruction
```

## Processing Sections

### Transient Path
```
Devices:
1. MClass EQ:
   - HP: 100Hz (remove rumble)
   - Peak: 4kHz (snap emphasis)
   - Shelf: 10kHz (air)

2. Pulveriser:
   - Follower: Fast (2ms)
   - Squash: 65%
   - Release: 50ms
   
Why These Settings:
- Preserves initial hit energy
- Maintains groove pocket
- Enhances dynamic range
- Keeps break character
```

### Room Path
```
Devices:
1. The Echo:
   - Time: 15-25ms (early reflections)
   - Feedback: 45%
   - Diffusion: Maximum
   - Filter: HP at 200Hz

Purpose:
- Recreates vintage room sound
- Adds depth and dimension
- Maintains groove cohesion
- Enhances break character
```

### Character Path
```
Devices:
1. Scream 4:
   - Damage Type: Tape
   - Damage Control: 35%
   - Body: Enhanced
   - Auto Makeup: On

Why This Matters:
- Adds harmonic richness
- Emulates vintage equipment
- Creates density and warmth
- Maintains transient clarity
```

## Combinator Controls

### Rotary 1: Break Character
```
Target Parameters:
- Pulveriser Squash
- Scream 4 Damage
- Echo Feedback

Range Settings:
- Min: Clean and Tight
- Max: Dense and Vintage
- Default: 50% (balanced)

Purpose:
- Single-knob character control
- Maintains coherent sound
- Preserves break essence
```

### Rotary 2: Room Space
```
Target Parameters:
- Echo Time
- Echo Diffusion
- EQ Room Resonance

Scientific Basis:
- Early reflections (15-25ms)
- Room modes (200-800Hz)
- Spatial coherence
```

### Rotary 3: Transient Design
```
Target Parameters:
- Pulveriser Attack
- Pulveriser Release
- Output Balance

Purpose:
- Shape hit intensity
- Control groove feel
- Balance elements
```

## Advanced Processing

### Frequency Splitting
```
Three-Band Setup:
1. Low (30-200Hz):
   - Kick focus
   - Sub preservation
   
2. Mid (200-5kHz):
   - Break character
   - Groove elements
   
3. High (5kHz+):
   - Air and detail
   - Transient clarity

Why Split:
- Independent processing
- Targeted enhancement
- Clean separation
- Better control
```

### CV Modulation
```
Matrix Patterns:
1. Transient Follow:
   - Source: Pulveriser Follower
   - Target: Filter Frequency
   - Amount: 25-50%

2. Room Modulation:
   - Source: LFO
   - Target: Echo Time
   - Amount: 10-15%

Purpose:
- Dynamic movement
- Organic variation
- Living character
```

## Creative Applications

### Break Transformation
```
1. Vintage Enhancement:
   - Heavy tape saturation
   - Room emphasis
   - Reduced transients

2. Modern Punch:
   - Enhanced transients
   - Controlled room
   - Clean separation

3. Hybrid Character:
   - Balanced processing
   - Selective vintage
   - Modern clarity
```

### Integration Techniques
```
1. With Modern Drums:
   - Phase alignment
   - Frequency carving
   - Dynamic balance

2. With Synth Elements:
   - Sidechain routing
   - Frequency spacing
   - Character blend
```

## Performance Setup

### Real-time Control
```
Macro Assignments:
1. Character Blend
2. Room Size
3. Transient Shape
4. Output Mix

Purpose:
- Live manipulation
- Dynamic adjustment
- Creative control
```

### Automation Points
```
Key Parameters:
1. Break Character
2. Room Amount
3. Transient Shape
4. Filter Movement

Creative Use:
- Build variations
- Create transitions
- Dynamic evolution
```

## Best Practices

### Source Material
```
Selection Criteria:
- Clean transients
- Minimal processing
- Good room sound
- Strong groove

Preparation:
- Align to grid
