# Loop Mashing Integration Guide

## Recording Setup

### Initial Configuration
1. Bus Setup:
   ```
   Create Bus Channel: "Break_Bits"
   Input Source: Bus Channel
   Audio Track: Stereo Input
   ```

2. Loop Preparation:
   - Time-stretch breaks to tempo
   - Set loop points
   - Enable pre-roll
   - Add padding bar

## Comping Workflow

### Recording Process
1. Layer Creation:
   - Record each break separately
   - Stack as takes
   - Maintain timing alignment
   - Keep original dynamics

2. Editing Approach:
   ```
   Tools: Razor (R)
   Mode: Comp Edit
   View: Show all takes
   ```

## Integration with Processing

### Break Processing
1. Post-Comp Processing:
   ```
   Comped Break > Kong > Effect Chain
   ```

2. Dynamic Controls:
   - Filter per section
   - Character processing
   - Parallel chains
   - Effect automation

### Kick Integration
1. Rhythmic Coordination:
   ```
   Kick Pattern > Break Selection
   Sub Focus > Break EQ
   Transient Alignment
   ```

2. Processing Balance:
   - Frequency carving
   - Dynamic interaction
   - Space allocation
   - Character blend

## Creative Applications

### Pattern Creation
1. Slice Selection:
   - Groove elements
   - Fill sections
   - Build components
   - Transition pieces

2. Processing Variations:
   - Per-section effects
   - Dynamic changes
   - Character shifts
   - Space modulation

### Performance Control
1. Live Manipulation:
   - Quick comp switching
   - Effect throws
   - Filter sweeps
   - Dynamic control

2. Automation:
   - Comp selection
   - Effect depth
   - Mix balance
   - Energy control

## Best Practices

### Organization
1. Take Management:
   - Label clearly
   - Group similar elements
   - Mark key sections
   - Save variations

2. Processing Structure:
   - Clean signal path
   - Efficient routing
   - CPU management
   - Preset organization

### Creative Tips
1. Pattern Building:
   - Start simple
   - Build complexity
   - Maintain groove
   - Create variations

2. Sound Design:
   - Balance elements
   - Control dynamics
   - Shape character
   - Preserve clarity
