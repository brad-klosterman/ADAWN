# Album Coherence: Wave Synchronization & Energy Flow

## Foundational Frequency Grid

### Key Centers
```
Track Relationships:
Base Frequencies:
A: 55Hz
B: 61.7Hz
C: 65.4Hz
D: 73.4Hz
E: 82.4Hz

Purpose:
- Creates harmonic relationships between tracks
- Maintains consistent physical impact
- Allows natural energy progression
```

### Phase Alignment Strategy
```
Sub Bass Coordination:
- Align kick fundamentals to key centers
- Maintain consistent phase relationships
- Use complementary frequencies between tracks

Implementation:
Track 1 → Track 2: Rise in frequency (energy build)
Track 2 → Track 3: Maintain or slight drop (energy sustain)
Track 3 → Track 4: New frequency center (energy shift)
```

## Energy Flow Architecture

### Album Journey Map
```
Opening Tracks (1-3):
- Focus on grounding frequencies (40-50Hz)
- Establish physical connection
- Build gradual resonance

Mid-Album (4-6):
- Peak energy frequencies (50-60Hz)
- Maximum physical engagement
- Complex harmonic interactions

Closing Tracks (7-9):
- Return to foundation frequencies
- Deeper, more spacious mix
- Resolution of energy patterns
```

### Track Transitions
```
Harmonic Bridging:
- Overlapping frequency ranges
- Complementary modulation patterns
- Shared resonant points

Energy Maintenance:
- Consistent sub presence
