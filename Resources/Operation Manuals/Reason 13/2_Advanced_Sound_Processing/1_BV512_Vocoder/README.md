## Quick Application Guide (pp. 606-611)

### Basic Vocoding
1. Connect modulator (voice)
2. Connect carrier (synth)
3. Set band count
4. Adjust attack/decay
5. Balance levels

### Creative Uses
- Equalizer mode
- Frequency analysis
- Sound design
- Rhythmic effects
- Spectral processing

## Best Practices
1. Choose appropriate band count
2. Use HF Emphasis for clarity
3. Adjust attack/decay per source
4. Monitor band levels
5. Consider FFT for detail
6. Use hold for effects
7. Experiment with different carriers

## Advanced Techniques
1. Individual Band Control:
   - Frequency shaping
   - Selective processing
   - Custom response curves
   - Dynamic control

2. Special Applications:
   - Robot voices
   - Spectral mixing
   - Frequency mapping
