# Channel EQ Equalizer

## Overview
The Channel EQ is a comprehensive equalizer combining both filtering and parametric EQ sections. It provides precise frequency control for mixing and sound shaping, with an intuitive interface and visual feedback.

## Global Controls (pp. 622)
- Input Gain
- Output Gain
- Phase Invert
- Bypass/On/Off switch
- Display with frequency response curve

## Filter Section (pp. 622)
### High-Pass Filter
- Frequency: 20 Hz to 4 kHz
- Slope: 12 dB/oct
- On/Off switch

### Low-Pass Filter
- Frequency: 100 Hz to 20 kHz

## Usage Tips
1. Basic EQ Techniques:
   - Use filters to remove unwanted frequencies
   - Make surgical cuts before boosts
   - Use Q control for precise adjustments
   - Monitor the frequency response display

2. Advanced Applications:
   - Mid/Side processing with multiple instances
   - Dynamic EQ using CV modulation
   - Parallel processing techniques

## Creative Applications
1. Instrument Treatment:
   - Bass enhancement
   - Drum shaping
   - Vocal presence
   - Guitar tone sculpting

2. Mix Processing:
   - Track balancing
   - Frequency masking reduction
   - Mix bus enhancement
   - Problem frequency removal

3. Sound Design:
   - Filter sweeps
   - Resonant effects
   - Telephone/radio effects
   - Tonal character shaping

## Best Practices
1. Start with subtle adjustments
2. Use your ears, not just your eyes
3. Consider the full frequency spectrum
4. Be mindful of phase relationships
5. Use high-pass filters to clean up low end
6. Match EQ moves to the source material
