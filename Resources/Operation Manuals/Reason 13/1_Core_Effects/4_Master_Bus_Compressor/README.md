# Master Bus Compressor

## Overview
The Master Bus Compressor is a professional-grade stereo compressor designed specifically for mix bus processing. It provides the "glue" and cohesion needed for professional mixes, with a classic analog-style compression character.

## Usage Tips
1. Mix Bus Processing:
   - Start with gentle settings (2:1 ratio)
   - Use moderate attack times (10-30ms)
   - Set release for natural movement
   - Apply subtle gain reduction (2-4 dB)

2. Advanced Techniques:
   - Parallel compression for punch
   - External sidechain for mix ducking
   - Program-dependent release for natural sound

## Creative Applications
1. Full Mix Processing:
   - Create mix cohesion
   - Add density and punch
   - Control dynamic range
   - Enhance mix energy

2. Subgroup Processing:
   - Drum bus compression
   - Bass compression
   - Vocal bus processing
   - Instrument group glue

## Best Practices
1. Monitor gain reduction carefully
2. Use your ears, not just meters
3. Compare bypassed and processed signals
4. Be gentle with threshold and ratio
5. Match make-up gain for proper comparison
6. Consider the genre and material
