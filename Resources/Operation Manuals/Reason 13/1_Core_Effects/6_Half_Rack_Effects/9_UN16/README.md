# UN-16 Unison

## Overview
The UN-16 Unison is a voice multiplier effect that creates rich chorusing and ensemble effects by generating multiple detuned copies of the input signal. It's perfect for thickening sounds and creating wide stereo images.

## Features (pp. 808)
- Up to 16 voice unison
- Voice detuning
- Stereo spreading
- CV modulation options
- Dry/wet mix control
- Stereo processing
