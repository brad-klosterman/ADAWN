# ECF-42 Envelope Controlled Filter

## Overview
The ECF-42 is a versatile envelope-controlled filter that combines a state variable filter with an envelope follower. It can create dynamic filter effects that respond to the input signal's amplitude.

## Features (pp. 804-805)
- State variable filter
- Envelope follower
- Multiple filter modes
- Resonance control
- CV modulation options
- Mono processing

3. Balance attack/decay times
4. Control resonance carefully
5. Monitor output levels
6. Use CV for movement
7. Consider filter mode choice

## Filter Mode Guide
1. Lowpass Mode:
   - Bass enhancement
   - Warmth control
   - Removing highs
   - Classic filtering

2. Bandpass Mode:
   - Mid frequency focus
   - Telephone effects
   - Frequency isolation
   - Wah-like sounds

3. Highpass Mode:
   - Bass reduction
   - High frequency emphasis
   - Thin sounds
   - Special effects

## Envelope Tips
1. Fast Settings:
   - Percussive effects
   - Tight response
   - Rhythmic filtering
   - Sharp modulation

2. Slow Settings:
   - Smooth transitions
