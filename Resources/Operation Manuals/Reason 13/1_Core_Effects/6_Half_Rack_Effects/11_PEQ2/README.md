# PEQ-2 Two Band Parametric EQ

## Overview
The PEQ-2 is a dual-band parametric equalizer offering precise frequency control with adjustable Q (bandwidth) for each band. Perfect for surgical EQ tasks and tone shaping.

## Features (pp. 810)
- Two fully parametric bands
- Frequency, gain, and Q control
- CV modulation for all parameters
- Mono processing
- Precision control
- Individual band bypass

## Parameters

### Band 1 (Low)
- Frequency: 30 Hz to 2 kHz
- Gain: ±18 dB
- Q: 0.1 to 10
- Bypass switch
- All CV controllable

### Band 2 (High)
- Frequency: 100 Hz to 20 kHz
- Gain: ±18 dB
- Q: 0.1 to 10
- Bypass switch
- All CV controllable

## Connections
### Audio
- Input: Mono audio input
- Output: Mono audio output

### CV (Per Band)
- Frequency CV In
- Gain CV In
- Q CV In

## Quick Application Guide
1. Tone Shaping:
   - Boost/cut specific frequencies
   - Control resonances
   - Shape instrument character
   - Fix problem frequencies

2. Creative Uses:
   - Frequency sweeps with CV
   - Dynamic EQ via CV
   - Wah-like effects
   - Notch filtering

## Best Practices
1. Use narrow Q for precision
2. Wide Q for general shaping
3. Moderate gain changes
4. Consider frequency overlap
5. Use bypass for comparison
6. Monitor output level
7. CV for dynamic control

## Common Applications
- Problem frequency removal
- Tone enhancement
- Mid-range control
- Frequency isolation
- Dynamic filtering
- Sound design
- CV-controlled effects
- Precision EQ tasks
