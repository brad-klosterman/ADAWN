# Audiomatic Retro Transformer

## Overview
The Audiomatic Retro Transformer is a creative audio effect device that transforms your sound using various algorithms and presets. It's designed to add character and color to your audio, with controls ranging from subtle enhancement to dramatic transformation.

## Parameters

### Gain (pp. 594)
- Input gain control
- Affects how hard the signal hits the transformer circuit
- Range: -inf to +12dB
- LED meter for visual feedback

### Transform (pp. 596)
- Main character selection control
- Different transformation algorithms
- Affects the core sound processing
- Multiple modes available for different effects

### Dry/Wet (pp. 596)
- Balances between processed and unprocessed signal
- Range: 0% (dry) to 100% (wet)
- Allows for parallel processing

### Volume (pp. 597)
- Output level control
- Compensates for gain changes
- LED meter for output monitoring

### Presets (pp. 595)
- Factory presets for quick access to different characters
- Save and recall user presets
- Browse through preset categories

## Connections (pp. 597)

### Audio
- Input L&R: Stereo audio input
- Output L&R: Stereo audio output

### CV
- CV Modulation In: Control voltage inputs for parameter modulation

## Usage Tips
